# SumoBot-2026
Hands-on robotics project focused on designing, building, and coding a competitive SumoBot. The robot is built entirely out of wood and powered by an ESP32, with all control logic developed using the Arduino IDE. This repository documents the full engineering process, from mechanical design &amp; electronics integration to embedded software &amp; testing.




Improvements

There are multiple improvements to be made to our robot. Firstly, our wedge design wasn't ideal. We were using wood, which made it really hard to get a precise and effective wedge shape. It is possible, but it would be way easier to make everything but the front side out of wood. Secondly, our code had some flaws. Our edge detection code was imperfect, which you can see in some of our rounds. This can be fixed by simply slowing our robot down, however, we wanted to utilize all of the torque in our motors in pushing matches. We tried to code a close distance mode and a far distance mode, but due to issues with edge detection, we weren't able to pull it off. The placement of our IR sensor didn't help. It was placed in the middle of our robot, which gave us less time to stop our sumobot when it reached the edge. This combined with momentum was a recipe for bad edge detection. A lot of our problems here could be solved by slowing our robot down, and having an additional IR sensor at the front to detect the enemy robot (and then ignore everything else except pushing). 

The third thing we could've improved is adding weight to our robot. Due to our robot not working until the last minute, we completely skipped adding additional weight to our robot. As a result, our robot weighed 230 grams in a 500 gram weight class. This caused us a lot of issues, and we could've won two more matches if we simply added coins below the back of the chassis. The fourth thing we could've improved was adding another navigation sensor on the sides to help with detection. This makes the code more complex, but in very competitive matches, it is worth it. Adding a sensor (or button) on the backside would also improve the robot's defenses quite a bit. Lastly, we could've implemented the wedge motors and code. Since the competition was next day, and our wedge motors would not work electrically, we decided to take out what didn't work and focus on what did work. Having wedge motors along with a better wedge shape would make a solid robot, but the wiring is very complex and messy (at least for our skill level).
